# TMS_Skype_Petcam
Uses the TMS320F28377S launchpad.

This project uses the launchpad to determine when a Skype call is answered (the answer tone is played) in order to
to power on the audio amp, set up the TV (turn on the TV over IR and select the right input), and do other skype
automated things. This works in conjunction with an old windows 7 desktop and a car audio amplifier. The goal
is to have a maintanance free pet cam that provides 2 way audio/video communication.
