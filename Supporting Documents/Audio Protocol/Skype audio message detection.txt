The easiest way to determine if a Skype call has been answered or ended when in "auto answer" mode
 is to set the call end to play a specific audio tone and also to set the chat received tone to a
 certain sound. If either of these sounds are played, our microcontroller should recognize them
 and do the corresponding action. Luckily, Skype filters its audio by low pass filtering the audio
 at a corner frequency of 250 Hz. We will take advantage of this fact and set our "active" tone to 20Hz.
 
Code 0 is a 20Hz wave for 800mS then 400mS of silence
Code 1 is a 20Hz wave for 1000 mS then 400mS of silence

The fundamental frequency os 20Hz.

To change the setting to play our code for each instance above:
1) Tools->Options
2) Notification Settings->Sounds
3) Unselect all (no sound should play for anything)
4) Click hang up and select import sound under my custom sounds (Code0.MP3)
5) Click IM in current chat and select import sound under my custom sounds (Code1.MP3)
6) Save
